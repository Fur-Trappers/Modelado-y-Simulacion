# Introduction

In the second century, Claudius Ptolomy, in his treatise 'Almagest', unveiled his concept of geocentric universe, in which the Sun, Moon, stars, and planets all orbit Earth. Each planet is moved in a small circle called the epicycle which, in turn, moves along a larger circle called the deferent. 
Both circles rotate clockwise.

Epicycles can be represented as complex Fourier series; so, with a large number of epicycles, very complicated trajectories can be represented in the complex plane.4
